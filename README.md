## Check back soon for live Heroku, AWS EC2 and ARM64 Hybrid Cloud demonsteration links!
We're migrating a lot of our services and properties right now and need a bit of time. Until then, enjoy the code!

## ./rubix-demos
### Seasonally in-process React playground and self-education tool
This hybrid ReactJS playground is Jen's first attempt at a more meaningful SPA experience, having done "like a billion" landing pages across a ten year FTE marketing developer position.

It's a floating, draggable cube, displaying nine of the latest Instagram images on each side, from a selectable set of hashtags. Some complex theming implementations at a demonstratable level, including Redux state management of the cube and Instagram requests, with Redux Sagas.

### Status: Ongoing
### Version: 0.3.6
### Condition
Typically only a few minor bugs, but ReactJS continues to grow in complexity with each new release of itself or its many npm packages.  So, you get what you pay for - something free and shiny to look at! If you pound that "watch" or "star" icon, you can be notified when Jen pushes something new. 

### Implementation Dependencies
See package.json for the full list. Below are some highlights.
- React 16.2.0
- Redux 3.7.2
- Webpack
- Style, URL, and SVG loaders
- NodeJS > 8
- Build and server tools

## ./aspnetcore-react-redux
### Retired ASP .NET Core MVC with Microsoft excel to JSON Web Service demonstration.
This was an attempt at taking the more "boilerplate-y" React templates for Visual Studio and producing a .NET Core SPA early in the development of .NET Core 2.

### Status: Retired
### Version: 1 (only 1)

### Implementation Dependencies
- .NET Core 2.1 with matching SDK
- Docker, for building an outputted, self-contained Web app that runs on any Linux box, even without .NET Core installed.
- React
- Redux
- NodeJS > 8
- Webpack
- A more current working knownedge of ASP .NET and C# than Jen has. SDK had several updates since Jen wrote this SPA in 2017.
